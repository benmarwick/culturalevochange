This package contains functions and other code from this article:

Crema, E.R., Edinborough, K, Kerig, T., Shennan, S. (2014), An Approximate Bayesian Computation approach for inferring patterns of cultural evolutionary change. *Journal of Archaeological Science* 50, 160-170. doi: 10.1016/j.jas.2014.07.014.

For the most part, I have taken the code supplied by the authors in the supplementary information for their paper, and arranged into an R package to make it easier to use and explore.

I've also added a bit of code in an attempt to reproduce the figures in the paper, since the code provided with the paper doesn't generate any figures.
